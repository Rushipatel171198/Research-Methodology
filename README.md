## Name of my Project

- Effective Security Frameworks in Cloud Computing

## Description of this project

- In recent times, the privacy and security of the user
data and other various types of data is inevitable. To secure
the data we should implement some encryption algorithms or
schemes to enhance the capabilities of various types of clouds.
- To regulate these kinds of services, one should be aware of
the security issues and how to protect the cloud servers from
anonymous attacks. 
- So, this file specifically directs to the
security and privacy concerns in cloud computing and how to
detect and get rid of it by using some framework or algorithms.
It is also crucial that how to increase the capacity of these types
of framework. I have prioritised the techniques according to
the capabilities of these frameworks, level based, complexity
and mathematical calculations. 

## Research on the topic of "Effective Data security Frameworks in Cloud Computing":
- Encrypting files is a good idea. You should encrypt your data using government-approved AES-256 strong encryption even before sending it to the cloud. The encryption is set up by your company, and only authorised employees have access to it. Because your data is stored in encrypted cloud storage, the cloud provider should not be able to see it!
Communication that is secure. All management communication between your systems and the provider's cloud should be secured, and all metadata should be encrypted as well. This implies that all parts of your data remain protected at all times.

- Firewall for web applications. A web application firewall (WAF) should be used by the provider, as it provides immediate protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, unauthorised resource access, remote file inclusion, and other OWASP (Open Web Application Security) threats.
The safety of data centres. High gates, 24x7 security staff, and video monitoring with 90-day archiving are all required for the physical data centre to be very secure. Access should also need biometric hand-geometry scans and proximity key cards.

- Availability of data centres. To minimise downtime and eliminate single points of failure, the cloud provider's infrastructure must achieve high availability SLAs by maintaining a redundant infrastructure. Furthermore, data centre electrical power systems must offer continuous power to the entire infrastructure 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Automatic uninterruptible power supplies provide power assistance during the switchover to diesel generators and defend against power surges in the event of switching power lines. At least two independent power sources should be used to power the data centres.

- Backups are made on a regular basis. To ensure that your data is secured in the event of a significant outage, the cloud provider must execute backups on a regular agreed-upon schedule.
- Best practises in the field. To protect against malicious or unknowingly dangerous acts by insiders, the provider should have implemented confidentiality and anonymity, business ethics, and code of conduct policies for all employees – including inspections where appropriate, non-disclosure arrangements, and principles of segregation of duties, need to know, and least privilege access. Only appropriate access to important systems is ensured by strict access controls, multi-factor authentication, and pervasive activity monitoring.

## The Answers I got from this research on various methods:

- The answers I got after getting this research done, are the
security levels which are of different types and it contains
authenticity, encryption, key management, hashing, authorization and other various kinds of operations which are used
in the RAdAC approach, Homomorphic encryption method
in which the functions are quite complex. Evaluating the
values of the functions is a complex task, the handling task
of large datasets.
- I have personally used Amazon Web Services, IBM cloud
Services for various applications for more than a year and
- I have observed that user credentials are more important to
secure the inner data which might get leaked.
So the other answers which I got is the improvement of
the frameworks can be happened if it’s done to remove or
try to reduce the complexity, less datasets, less sensible, less
overhead, confidentiality constraints and so on.
These factors directly affect the effectiveness of the security and privacy frameworks where the users data and
credentials are vulnerable. The shortcomings in this topic is
how to detect the bugs and loopholes in the system because it
is a challenging task to find those in cloud as it is quite vital
part nowadays, most of the applications are having cloud
storage, other services and they have millions of users right
now.

## The Results I got after the research:

- Access control, security, and maintaining and managing
user identities are the most pressing concerns. When offering
a service to a user, their identities are required to maintain
high security, and identity as a service (IDaaS) is utilized
for this purpose. In both public and private clouds, IDaaS
is critical for all services, including software, platform, and
infrastructure. Because the application data in the enterprise
environment may be disrupted by a third party, an identity
management system is critical.
- Hence, prioritising these methods the nature of the SAML
and HBE method is quite acceptable and the results obtained
from this method can be used at the zero level of the security
as it provides the security to the users credentials.
Results reflect that every algorithm has some kind of
negatives and positives in implementing in cloud system.
Isolated, central, centric, and federated identity management approaches are used by IDaaS to manage all user
information. The key issues are securing user identities and
managing trust between the user and the service provider.
The identities are controlled in the proposed system utilizing
Security Assertion Markup Language, Single SignOn, and
an encryption technique. SAML is an extensible markup
language that allows users to communicate with service
providers using specific authentication. In the identity management, the single signon approach uses a hash-based
encryption algorithm to ensure acceptable protection for user
entities.

- The user must first register their information with the
identity provider and then encrypt it with a specific length
of key that is used to manage the user information for
further processing. The whole assertion and authentication
process used during sign-on serves to increase the privacy of
servicerelated identities. In HBE, each user has a unique set
of keys that are used to verify the password using encryption
and decryption keys. To access cloud services, the user
identifier, a 128-bit keyword, is utilized to offer complete
security and authentication. 
Because both the service provider and the user have
different encryption and decryption keys when sharing a
password over the internet, the encryption technique gives
the best security. As a result, an identity provider protects user attributes against third-party access. Furthermore,
outside parties attempting to access user information using
encryption and decryption keys with various protocols can
be easily identified. Additionally, the encryption algorithm is
used to address the absence of service access, process, and
data management in this proposed system.


## Conclusion & Future work for this research topic or ROADMAP:

- To conclude, this file contains about the privacy and
security preserving techniques which are mentioned in the paper. How the techniques would
work and what are the advantages and disadvantages of them
is mentioned in this research. 
- It is also recommended that, the frameworks do not work fully as they have some negatives too.
So, to improve it is necessary to optimize the frameworks.

- The future work of this topic depends upon the optimization of the frameworks and to bring more effectiveness of
them in cloud computing.
- The frameworks which are having quite less cons which
are cryptography, SAML and HBE, Clustering & Encryption
are the most useful methods to provide security to the users.
- The complex systems must have a solution to get the
things easier for the developers, because it gives some
flexibility to the users. Hence the future work depends on
this task.
